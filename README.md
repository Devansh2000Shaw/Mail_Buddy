MailBuddy :

Our team “Tigerack” have successfully came up with a hack for the given themes “Recurring Mail".

 We have tried to make a website that can send recurring mails and for this purpose we have used a beautiful Dark theme background and various text editing functionality in the mail section that opens after going to get strated section,
 user can easily change the font format and make it bold, italic and  underline the text as well,besides this user can also align the text in center,left and right,
 we have also added the function to insert any document in the mail.We have made Beautiful Home, About,Register and Login Pages all using React. For saving the Data we have used MongoDB Atlas.

Technologies used: To turn our idea into reality we have used MERN STACK.For storing the data into Database we have used MongoDB atlas.
